I love tokenization in NLP.
Tokenization helps split the text into smaller units.
Subword tokenization improves model performance.
Byte Pair Encoding is a popular tokenization technique.
Unigram Language Model is another approach to tokenization.
WordPiece is used in models like BERT.
Byte-level BPE works with byte characters.
This is a simple example to demonstrate tokenization.
